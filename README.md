# Project-1---College-Recruitment-Improvement-Study.-
The CCM Department of Information Technologies seeks to improve its recruitment process and increase the number of individuals from under-represented groups in its computing classes and majors.  A survey is administered every Fall semester in entry-level computing classes and computer literacy courses (for non-majors). I have been tasked to perform exploratory data analysis that informs the department about who/what/when/where/why students are taking their classes so that they can focus their recruiting efforts in those areas that are successful, particularly for under-represented groups.
