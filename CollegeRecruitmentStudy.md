### "How many students from each different class responded to the survey?"

217 people in total, 150 from Computer Science 1, 34 from Fundamentals of Programming, 9 for Intro to IT, and 24 from Internet and Web Design.

### "What are the gender percentages?"

Men: 74.7%

Women: 19.4%

Prefer not to say: 3.2%

Non-Binary: 1.4%

Does not Identify: 1.4%

### "What is the racial/ethnic diversity? For those students selecting more than one race/ethnicity, assign multi-racial to their category."

Pivot table is in the Sheets data file.

### "What is the age distribution for the survey?"

Graph for age distribution is in the Sheets data file.

One question I asked was "What events are most impactful on students that take these classes?"

Through the data, I found that an individual CCM visit was impactful for 33% of students that answered either yes or no, having it be the most impactful of all events.

In second with 30% is an on campus info session

In third with 25% is an open house

In fourth with 23% is info from high school

In fifth with 14% is titan tuesdays virtual information

Another question I asked was "What was the best way students heard about this program?"

Through the data, I found that most people heard about CCM or this program through a friend or family member, with nearly 77% of students saying so. 

In second with 58%, is word through a counselor

In third with 55% is a teacher

In fourth with 43% is a current CCM student

In fifth with 36% is from the CCM website

### For a selected population...

Women that take these classes are usually more diverse. 69% of women taking these classes are not white/caucasian.

For those women that answered, 38% of them were positively impacted by taking an individual CCM tour.

### Insights

One insight that could help the department is to probably not use radio, television or in-app advertisement since less than 4% of students were affected by them. Instead focus on the top percentage, which is mainly transferred through word of mouth. Also keep up the helpfulness of the website since that is something they can fully control.

Since nearly 68% of students are under the age of 20, you may be able to assume that they live with a guardian or parent. Try and find ways to have the parent/guardian tell kids about CCM. One way is to send mail to the residence or to send an e-mail directly to the parent/guardian. That way hopefully the elders will see this as a good idea and persuade their dependent into looking into CCM and the computer science field. In my personal experience, you cannot trust a young adult to be able to act on this info without some form of adult help.
